# HangMan

I created this program to help teach myself thw syntax of C++. It reads a words.txt file and randomly chooses a word to be used. It takes user input to guess what word it is, and will track incorrect guesses and display a stick figure man being hung with each wrong guess. The word, player name, and score is the written in th hihscores text file, and this file can be viewed in the program ig the view highcores option is selected.
